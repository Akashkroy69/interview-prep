# Backtracking/Exhaustive search (In progress)


## Paradigm:

1. Do the first step
2. Perform recursion on the remaining subproblem
3. Undo the first step and proceed

## When to use this:

Use backtracking/exhaustive search when you either have to go back or when the problem may have more than 1 result and you want all of them.

## Problems:

1. N Queens (Leetcode 51)
2. Permutations of a given string (Leetcode 46)
3. Word Ladder (Leetcode 127)
4. Sudoku solver (Leetcode 37)
