# Overview

A greedy algorithm is one that builds on the solution by choosing best option at each step. Since greedy only gets the local optimum, this might not be the global optimum hence greedy algorithms do not always work. We must be able to prove that the greedy algorithm arrives at the most optimal answer for it to be correct.
