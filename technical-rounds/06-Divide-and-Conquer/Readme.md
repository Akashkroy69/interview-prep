# Divide and Conquer

## Overview

Divide and conquer is basically this:
- Split the input 
- Compute the best result for the inputs that have been split
- The answer is either:
  - The better answer of the 2 parts
  - The answer created by joining the 2 parts in some way.

## Complexity

The complexity of divide and conquer algorithms can be figured out using the Master theorem.
